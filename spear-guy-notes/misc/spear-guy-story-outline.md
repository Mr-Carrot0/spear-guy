# Timeline 

## Tutorial section 

1. A basic obstacle course showcasing movement and traditional spear combat, guided by [the Prince](chars/spear-guy.md)'s personal teacher of physical combat and the way of the spear

## Beginnings (10 years later)

1. [Raven of the Night](chars/raven-of-the-night.md) kills the [King of Spears](chars/King-of-Spears) with a black knife through the heart at an official ceremony
2. [Raven of the Night](chars/raven-of-the-night.md)
3. This incident incident causes a nation-wide ban on non-polearm weaponry as they're the only type that's virtually impossible to hide and the spear is  considered a holy in the present religion.
4. [The Prince](chars/spear-guy) who's now determined to avenge his father, is granted [The Spear Of Destruction](<items/The Spear Of Destruction.md>) by the Church.
5. A high priest and [spear guy](<chars/Spear guy.md>)'s old teacher quickly teaches how [The Spear Of Destruction](items/the-spear-of-destruction.md) differs from the regular spear he was trained with (extremely effective on weapons, but not better than a regular spear against flesh and amour) 

## The Adventure

1. [The prince](spear-guy.md) wastes no time and sets off as soon as he's suited up with his trademark blue amour and now a the purple and blue-tipped spear in the directions the reports and sightings of [Raven of the Night](chars/raven-of-the-night.md) lead him. 
2. [...]
3. He finally catches up with [Raven](chars/raven-of-the-night.md), but he explains that the kingdom of spears is under attack by a horde of flesh eating carrot creatures and he should prioritize his kingdom instead of grasping for any chance for petty revenge.
4. [CHOICE]
	- Ignore him 
		1. Epic boss fight with [Raven of the Night](chars/raven-of-the-night.md)
		2. Kingdom was about to be wiped out by the monsters, but with the help of the local demon population, only half of the population died in the attack
		3. [Spear guy](chars/spear-guy.md) is exiled for ignoring his duties as the heir to the throne and protector of the lands.
		4. The Kingdom of Spears is no longer a kingdom and is instead ruled by a court of 50% humans and 50% demons, since they, unlike the traitorous [prince](chars/spear-guy.md) actually helped save the kingdom.
	- Take the advice of a murderer
		1. [Spear guy](chars/spear-guy.md) fights a gauntlet of carrot monsters
		2. He gets help from demons while in a tight spot
		3. [CHOICE] - Demons offer help
			1. [Spear Guy](chars/spear-guy.md) makes a truce with the demons to ensure equal rights between the species and include demons in his court so they can voice their opinions. 
			2. [Spear Guy](chars/spear-guy.md) rejects the offer and the demons leave him to die 
			3. Same as ignore-him
5. The ban on non-polearm weaponry is lifted due to the crisis and new rule.
