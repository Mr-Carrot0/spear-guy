[Spear guy](chars/spear-guy.md) will be a combat platformer, with the twist that your goal is to disarm your opponent, by either by straight destroying the weapon or remove it from their hands, rather than killing them. 

Every Actor (non-npc) will have a Weapon assigned to them which will have its independent health and stats. [The spear of destruction](items/the-spear-of-destruction.md) (which [the protagonist](spear-guy.md) will wield) will have infinite health and therefore will never break, unlike the weapons of the enemies.
