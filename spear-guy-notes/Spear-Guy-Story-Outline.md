# Beginnings (10 years later)

1. [Raven of the Night](Raven-Of-the-Night.md) kills the [King of Spears](chars/King-of-Spears) with a black knife through the heart at an official ceremony
2. [Raven of the Night](Raven-Of-the-Night.md)
3. This incident incident causes a nation-wide ban on non-polearm weaponry as they're the only type that's virtually impossible to hide and the spear is  considered a holy in the present religion.
4. The Prince ([Spear guy](<chars/Spear guy.md>)) who's now determined to avenge his father, is granted [The Spear Of Destruction](<items/The Spear Of Destruction.md>) by the Church.
5. A high priest and [spear guy](<chars/Spear guy.md>)'s old teacher quickly teaches how [The Spear Of Destruction](The-Spear-Of-Destruction.md) differs from the regular spear he was trained with (extremely effective on weapons, but not better than a regular spear against flesh and amour) 

# The Adventure

1. [The prince](spear-guy.md) wastes no time and sets off as soon as he's suited up with his trademark blue amour and now a the purple and blue-tipped spear in the directions the reports and sightings of [Raven of the Night](chars/Raven-Of-the-Night.md) lead him. 
2. [...]
3. He finally catches up with [Raven](chars/Raven-Of-the-Night.md), but he explains that the kingdom of spears is under attack by a horde of flesh eating carrot creatures and he should prioritize his kingdom instead of grasping for any chance for petty revenge.
4. [CHOICE]
	- Ignore him 
		1. Epic boss fight with [Raven of the Night](chars/Raven-Of-the-Night.md)
