I want to have a big enemy


it should have a weak spot

and use animation tree or simular to manage state

maybe a shoot mode, where it shoots projectiles aimed at the player
canons, knifes, etc

and a slam mode where it


to kill it you need to get up to it's weak spot

<!-- or the spot that has health component--> 



but the swords should be breakable?
maybe a sword could be the weak spot
and the rest of the body could be something the spear cannot destroy, shield?

according to chatgpt
spear is weak to close range weapons, shields, and heavy wapons

maybe we could say that the enemy has gieant, hammers, greatsword, or mace
